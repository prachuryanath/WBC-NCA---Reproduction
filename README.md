### Abstract
The paper presents a **Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)-based approach** for white blood cell classification in peripheral blood smears. The method addresses key challenges in deep learning:
- Generalizability
- Domain shifts
- Explainability

The NCA model achieves competitive performance across three datasets while being **lightweight** and requiring **fewer parameters**. Unlike conventional deep learning models, NCA offers **natural interpretability** and robustness against domain shifts, making it a viable option for clinical hematological diagnosis.
